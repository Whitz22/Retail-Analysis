Retirees with the highest value
New families represent low value in terms of purchasing behaviour
This will definitely affect the analysis of the data due to the misrepresentation of different lifestages.



There is an outlier which needs to be dropped

The lowest total sales value is associated with the "NEW FAMILIES" life stage and "Premium"  customer segment, with a total sales amount of $10,760.80.
The highest total sales value is associated with the "OLDER FAMILIES" life stage and "Budget" customer segment, with a total sales amount of $156,863,725.

There are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy chips. This con￾tributes to there being more sales to these customer segments but this is not a major driver for the Budget
- Older families segment.


From the data provided, the highest total sales value is associated with the "OLDER SINGLES/COUPLES" , with a total sales amount of $376,019.65 .
The lowest total sales value is associated with the "NEW FAMILIES" with a total sales  of $47,347.95

Mainstream midage and young singles and couples are more willing to pay more per packet of chips com￾pared to their budget and premium counterparts. This may be due to premium shoppers being more likely to
buy healthy snacks and when they buy chips, this is mainly for entertainment purposes rather than their own
consumption. This is also supported by there being fewer premium midage and young singles and couples
buying chips compared to their mainstream counterparts.
